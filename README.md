# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to utilize SQL to go over a number of CSV databases in order to identify the amount of retiring employees based on their titles and ones that could be utilized to mentor in a new set of replacements as they approach retirement. We can then understand how many people are going to be leaving the company and understand how big of an impact this is going to have for our labor structure. Doing so we can help prep for this so called “silver tsunami“ which is about to hit the company.

## RESULTS
Based on the first deliverable, we were trying to determine retirement age is amongst those who were born between 1952 to 1955, whilst partitioning through all of the employee titles and the amount of titles that will be filled. This is the data that we have found:

We have confirmed that there is going to be a major indeed shift in the company:
- After running the analysis of the unique titles csv, we found that there are 90,398 potential retiring employees.

- After creating the retiring titles csv, there appears to be 133,776 titles to fill for those retiring.

- A majority of which are in senior staff, technical leadership, or high-level engineering positions: we have 29,414 senior engineers, 28,250 for senior staff, 14,222 engineers, 12,243 staff, 4,502 technique leaders, 1,761 assistant engineers and two managers that are potentially retiring.

This could be a huge blow to our workforce and with a majority of these staffing positions being very technical or high-level in terms of experience needed we need to invest heavily into our mentor ship program to try to move employees into these positions as fast as possible.

Looking over the information we collected during the second deliverable about mentorship eligibility we found this in our data:

- There are 1,549 potential mentors for the sudden labor change, with a large amount of them being amongst our senior engineering and staff roles. 

This could pose a problem due to the amount of potential employees that we need to mentor in case a larger amount of our retirement population decides to leave at the same time. The company should prepare for a mentoring crunch.

## SUMMARY
In summary we’re going to need to fill about 133,776 rolls in the future in order to stave off the silver tsunami that we were seeing in our labor force. However, this does appear to be a larger number than needed as many employees held more than one role. still in the near future we are expected to have to replace over 90,000 potential employees as they approach retirement and we need to address this quickly. However we do not know what employees are going to retire for certain. So in order to potentially alter our data for the better, as well as better prep ourselves for the labor shortage, I would suggest a query or gathering more data on the specific time frames for each of these employees retirements. If they do not plan on retiring immediately we can move them into the mentorship eligibility tab and potentially boost up a very critical and lacking component of the silver tsunami. This timeline is critical to understanding how quickly we are going to drown in this labor shortage.

As we can infer with the aforementioned problem with our mentorship eligibility, we do not have nearly enough mentors to be able to handle this employment shortage. We’re looking to replace 90,000+ employees, 1,549 mentors is not nearly enough. I will conduct two additional data analysis tables if I had the data available. First off I will conduct agree on the exact amount of each title we have in our mentorship eligibility, perhaps mimicking the query we made with retiring titles. Perhaps with this we can understand exactly what areas would drastically need more mentors. Secondly, I would hope to be able to go through a itemized table of all their various skill sets and then experience so we can understand what areas we need to focus on for our hiring. we could utilize the mentors as frame works for hiring, and either look into matching or increasing the requirements in terms of experience or skill set to fill these positions. 

In summary, I feel that we need to focus heavily in understanding how quickly we’re going to submerge with the upcoming retirement of almost 100,000 of our employees, and the company needs to quickly address the amount of mentorship roles we have. We need to increase the amount of employees that we can utilize to train newcomers or invest heavily into computerized training equipment.
